# PDF Question-Answer & Question Generation with Langchain
This project provides a powerful chatbot that allows users to interact with their PDF documents by asking questions and receiving accurate answers. Additionally, it can generate relevant questions from the content of the PDFs. This chatbot can be easily integrated into Python-based frameworks like Flask.

Let's start talking about what we expect from these conversation bots. We don't want them to give non-sense, unrelated answers. To avoid that we can either use prompts or conversation chains. In this case, we will be using chains. 

# Commitment To The Document
- **I gave this text which was in the document.**

- **This doesnt entirely proves that only answers from the document so I had to be sure and I asked one more question.**

- **Overall, I'm convinced that this set-up only answers from the document.**
- **Whenever I ask non-sense question. It says ***"I don't know"*** which is what we expect.**

# How To Run On Local Systems
```python
    git clone https://github.com/AtakanG7/robotiXe.git
```

Create virtual envirement (required!) Trust me :)
```python
    python -m venv your_env_name
```
Now, the envirement is supposed to be added to your directory. You need to activate it. 

```python
    .your_env_name\Scripts\activate
```
Congratulations, you are half way there. Now install the dependencies.

```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will take some time.
After all things set up, you need to run the project

```python
    streamlit run main.py
```
